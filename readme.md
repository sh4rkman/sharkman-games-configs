## Introduction


In this package, you'll find my whole *go-to* setup for Counter Strike Global Offensive, witch include :  

##### Configurations Files  :

- CSGO language for Notepad++  
- VibranceGUI  
- SimpleRadar  



## Installation  

:warning:  
##### Disclamer :  
**If you need a tutorial for using my autoexec & others things, you should probably stop there.  
You are going to mess with your CSGO Install.**


 If you know how an autoexec work, here's some advices anyway :  
 
 1. [Download ](https://github.com/sh4rkman/CSGO_CONFIG/archive/master.zip)  the package and unzip it.  
   
 2.  Copy & Replace the `cfg` folder to your CSGO config folder (usually `..\Steam\steamapps\CounterStrickGlobalOffensive\csgo\cfg\`   
 
 3.  **Edit autoexec.cfg with your own preference**  
 
	 I use `unbind all` ***then*** re-bind every keys i use in my autoexec. This way i make sure that nothing will move.  You ***have*** to replace my keys with yours in the autoexec, otherwise changes will be lost the next time you launch CSGO. 
	
Or You can erase all my binds (you lazy fucks, they are great).

 4.  **Choose your Resolution**   
 


Copy & Replace `video.txt` into `..\Steam\steamapps\CounterStrickGlobalOffensive\csgo\`  
	
There is nothing to edit in this file but your resolution. It contains the lowest/best video settings for the game imho. If you still want to change some settings because you prefere anti-aliasing x8 or whatever, use the game menu; it will write this file with your changes.

Right now, i'm using a standart 16/9 - 1920\*1080 resolution stretched on a 21/9 monitor.  

If you have a standart 16/9 monitor, I suggest to use a *custom-non-standard* **1440\*1080** resolution. This is a 4/3 stretched resolution that i used to have before getting an ultrawide.  If you want to be able to use it, you need to create it first in your Nvidia Control Panel. ([Tutorial here for Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/object/custom_resolutions.html))
  
 5. **Setup your launch options**   

	Right-Click CSGO in your Steam library > Options > Launch Options.
	
	##### My Personal CSGO launch options :
	
	> *-novid  -freq 144 -language english*  
	 
	
	**`-novid`** Skip the Valveâ„¢ logo & shit at startup  
	**`-freq 144`** force the monitor refreshrate to 144hz. (only if you are using a 144hz monitor. If you have no idea, let get 		it straight : you don't have a 144hz monitor; don't use -freq.)  
	**`-language english`** overwrite english over my french CSGO version  
	
	
	
	##### Others :  
	
	I'm 99,99% sure this options don't do shit but you can still use it if you're into placebo effect
	
	**`-console`** Open Console at startup  
	Was usefull back when Source was the thing. Not anymore.  
	**`-w` & `-h`** resolution  
	It gets forced by autoexec & video.txt anyway    
	**`-high`** high-priority mode  
	Every two months, a random guy on the internet claim that this will make you gain 150FPS.  
	Every two months, 2 thousands people try *-high* and it doesn't do shit.
